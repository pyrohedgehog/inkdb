ok, so the goal here is to have something that is as fast as possible to store new data. Incrementally, hence, inkDB. All data must have an incremental key value.
core storage is a key value db.


after having worked on this a bit:
###InkDB
the following options work(or will)
GET <from> <to>. Returns all items in order, from one ink-sack (table)
PUT <ink-sack> <data>. Appends a piece of data to a specific ink-sack
PLACE <ink-sack> <key> <data>. Like append, but will (attempt) to place the data at a specific point. No promises of support though.
KICK <from> <to>. removes all data between those points. Ideal for removing expired data.

##places for improvement

#threading.
I need to add some thread safety, but each query should (ideally) be able to be ran in it's own thread.

#storage limitations
currently, each table needs all of its contents to be in the same file location. If i change that, to allow multiple file locations, we can have redundancy files, as well as tables that take up multiple storage devices.

#support
I wouldn't even count this as supporting MacOS yet...
